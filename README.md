Thank you for opening my README file! This project was a brief exercise in front-end web development using HTML and CSS in an attempt to recreate the look of the Google homepage. This is part of the Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

Although the buttons are lacking in functionality and the user cannot search, I took care to make sure all of the links were functional and that the page looked as close to the original as possible, using the HTML and CSS that I know. Div tags were helpful in keeping my work organized as much as possible, and many CSS classes were used to make the code readable.

One of the most difficult parts of this project was configuring the search bar so that I could have a text input field inside of a long, rounded border, with an image on either side. A few different methods were tried but eventually I came to the conclusion to just put a text field on top of a static image. It was probably not the ideal solution and it was not how the code looks on the real Google home page, but it got the job done. I also had some trouble getting the gray bar at the bottom to fill out the page. In the end, I settled for "close enough" which fits within the scope of what was expected for this project, as I do not have enough knowledge yet to know how I would fix that.

This has been a useful exercise to get my toes wet, and I feel that I learned a lot.
